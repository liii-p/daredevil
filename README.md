# Daredevil Project

This is a passion (nerdy) project I am working on in my free time, focused on Marvel Studio's television show, Daredevil.
My aim for this project is to improve my skills in react, learn new web design skills and just to make a fun website that is visually appealing for the user :)

## IDEAS AND DESIGN

- Parallax Scrolling (fancy scrolling to make it more visually engaging for the user.)
- Daredevil's signature colour is red, so naturally I'm going to mainly use red for the colour scheme, with black as contrast.
- Headline "JUSTICE IS BLIND" followed by Daredevil hero image
- Interactive text on hover

### MICROINTERACTIONS

The best way to retain a user's attention is through microinteractions which cause the webpage to react based on how the user interacts with it!

Fundamental microinteractions:

- Tap effects
- Swipe effects
- Tap and hold effects
- Scroll-into-view
- Pull-to-refresh
- Progress bar
- Errors
- Sound
- Button state changes
- Tactile
- Mouse over / hover effects
- Slide-in/out
- System feedback
- Page transitions (fade, explode, etc.)

Examples:

- Facebook's react feature (animated emojis - tap and hold effect)
- Mouse-over effects
- Scroll into view (for my website - text fades in/out, images get larger and smaller, etc.)

I do not want to drown my website in microinteractions, so I'm going to use them selectively.

## TO DO

- Add animations/micro-interactions
- Add loading animation(s)

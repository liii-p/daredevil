# Daredevil Project

This is a passion (nerdy) project I am working on in my free time, focused on Marvel Studio's television show, Daredevil.
My aim for this project is to improve my skills in react, learn new web design skills and just to make a fun website that is visually appealing for the user :)

## IDEAS AND DESIGN

- Parallax Scrolling (fancy scrolling to make it more visually engaging for the user.)
- Daredevil's signature colour is red, so naturally I'm going to mainly use red for the colour scheme, with black/white as contrast.
- Headline "JUSTICE IS BLIND" with Daredevil hero image as background
- Interactive text on hover (maybe)

- Under associates, users can click on each character's name to display a modal containing more information about said character.

### MICROINTERACTIONS

The best way to retain a user's attention is through microinteractions which cause the webpage to react based on how the user interacts with it!

Fundamental microinteractions:

- Tap effects (mobile)
- Swipe effects (mobile)
- Tap and hold effects (mobile)
- Scroll-into-view
- Pull-to-refresh
- Progress bar

I do not want to drown my website in microinteractions, so I'm going to use them selectively.

## TO DO

- Add animations/micro-interactions
- Add loading animation(s)

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Upon first loading the website, the home page image does not load and it requires a refresh in order to properly load. Must look into website optimisation.
- When interacting with modal content, if the same modal component is used then all the modals will be loaded no matter which character is clicked. Need to investigate making them individually responsive.

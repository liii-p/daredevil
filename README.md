# Daredevil Project

This is a passion project I have worked on in my free time, focussed on Marvel Studio's television show Daredevil.

## IDEAS AND DESIGN

- Parallax Scrolling (fancy scrolling to make it more visually engaging for the user.)
- Daredevil's signature colour is red, so naturally I'm going to mainly use red for the colour scheme, with black as contrast.
- Headline "JUSTICE IS BLIND" followed by Daredevil hero image
- Interactive text on hover
